# Image Segmentation Using EM Algorithm

Image segmentation is splitting of a image into multiple segments ( different sets of pixels
called as blob or super-pixel ) based on some distinctive features . Here we are segmenting
image into different regions based on pixel color. Human eye can easily distinguish different
color regions but how we will a computer do ?? There are various algorithms for color
image segmentation, we are using EM Algorithm here. Image segmentation is an important
technique/tool for rapid digital image processing and is used in various machine learning,
computer vision and deep learning applications.
Image segmentation can be used to locate distinct objects in the image to draw meaningful
insights. Self driving cars, satellites, medical imaging involves image segmentation technique.
A more lot of things can be done using color image segmentation as it helps computer
to understand images at semantic level and add perception capabilities.
